      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Pulling the plug on the internet is one of the ways that governments around the
world attempt to exert control over the flow of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ooni.torproject.org/&#34;&gt;Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)&lt;/a&gt; project has developed numerous &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe&#34;&gt;software tests&lt;/a&gt; for examining different
forms of internet censorship (such as the blocking of websites, instant
messaging apps, and censorship circumvention tools), we currently do not have
tests that are designed to examine internet blackouts, when the internet as a
whole is rendered inaccessible within a location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last months we received many reports relating to internet blackouts in
various countries around the world. In some of these countries we had probes
running &lt;a href=&#34;https://ooni.torproject.org//nettest/&#34;&gt;OONI tests&lt;/a&gt;, but merely
asserting that an internet blackout had occurred just because we stopped
receiving measurements probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been accurate. As such, we started
to refer to other public data sources that could help us gain a better
understanding of potential network disruptions in countries where internet
blackouts were reported by locals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post we outline some &lt;em&gt;basics&lt;/em&gt; from our methodology when examining internet
blackouts through public data sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;identifying-data-sources&#34;&gt;Identifying data sources&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main criterion for identifying data sources that can help shed light on
network disruptions is that they collect and publish a &lt;strong&gt;large volume of internet
traffic&lt;/strong&gt; from as many countries around the world as possible (including, of
course, the country where an internet blackout has been reported), or that they
provide insight into the &lt;strong&gt;routing&lt;/strong&gt; within networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some public data sources, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/traffic/?hl=en#expand=CG&#34;&gt;Google Transparency Reports&lt;/a&gt;,
provide data with large volumes of internet traffic because they are produced by
companies offering internet services used by large populations across many
countries around the world. Other data sources, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.measurementlab.net/tools/ndt/&#34;&gt;NDT measurements&lt;/a&gt;, publish data collected
from probes monitoring network performance globally. And other data sources,
like &lt;a href=&#34;https://metrics.torproject.org/&#34;&gt;Tor Metrics&lt;/a&gt;, publish daily measurements
from around the world pertaining to the use of particular software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data sources that provide insight into the potential routing within networks can
also be useful when examining internet blackouts. BGP data aggregated by
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ripe.net/&#34;&gt;RIPE&lt;/a&gt;, for example, enables us to monitor routing
information for the country in question and to examine whether it has been
disconnected from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, some public data sources that we refer to when examining internet
blackouts include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/traffic/?hl=en#expand=CG&#34;&gt;Google Product Traffic&lt;/a&gt; data (via Google Transparency Reports)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.measurementlab.net/tools/ndt/&#34;&gt;NDT measurement&lt;/a&gt; data (via &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.measurementlab.net/&#34;&gt;M-Lab&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ripe.net/&#34;&gt;RIPE&lt;/a&gt; data (including public measurements and BGP announcement data)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://store.steampowered.com/stats/&#34;&gt;Steam stats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://metrics.torproject.org/&#34;&gt;Tor Metrics&lt;/a&gt; data (which is specific to the use of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/&#34;&gt;tor software&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.routeviews.org/&#34;&gt;Route Views Project&lt;/a&gt; BGP announcement data archive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA): &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.caida.org/projects/ioda/&#34;&gt;Internet Outage Detection and Analysis (IODA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dyn Research: &lt;a href=&#34;http://b2b.renesys.com/eventsbulletin/&#34;&gt;Outages Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internet-Wide Scan Data Repository: &lt;a href=&#34;https://scans.io/study/washington-dns&#34;&gt;Longterm DNS survey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above list is not exhaustive and the listed data sources present various
limitations. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.measurementlab.net/tools/ndt/&#34;&gt;NDT measurement data&lt;/a&gt;,
for example, is limited by the amount of probes deployed which may not include
equal coverage across countries around the world, while &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/traffic/?hl=en#expand=CG&#34;&gt;Google traffic data&lt;/a&gt; is
limited by the amount of users Google has in each country of question. Such data
sources, however, can potentially help gain insight into the volume of internet
traffic originating from various countries around the world through further
examination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;examining-data-sources&#34;&gt;Examining data sources&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most public data sources (as listed in the previous section) allow us to select
a country and to observe the flow of internet traffic originating from it across
time. If a country-wide internet blackout has occurred, we would expect to see
almost no internet traffic origination from a country during the reported period
of a blackout. This, for example, was evident in Ethiopia in August 2016, when
an internet blackout was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36940906&#34;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of political protests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graph below, taken from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/traffic/?hl=en#expand=CG&#34;&gt;Google traffic data&lt;/a&gt;,
clearly illustrates that no internet traffic was originating from Ethiopia
between 6th to 8th August, confirming that an internet blackout occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ooni.torproject.org/post/ethiopia-internet-shutdown-amidst-recent-protests/ethiopia-google-traffic.png&#34; alt=&#34;Ethiopia google traffic&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/traffic/explorer/?r=GM&amp;amp;l=WEBSEARCH&amp;amp;csd=1479483000000&amp;amp;ced=1480692600000&#34;&gt;Google traffic data&lt;/a&gt; in the graph
below shows a clear disruption of internet traffic originating from the Gambia
between 30th November to 2nd December, when an internet blackout was
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ooni.torproject.org/post/gambia-internet-shutdown/&#34;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; during
the country’s 2016 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ooni.torproject.org/post/gambia-shutdown/gambia-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;Twitter post&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Google traffic data, it’s also particularly useful to look at BGP
announcement data aggregated by RIPE from different &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ripe.net/analyse/internet-measurements/routing-information-service-ris/faq-ris/what-is-a-remote-route-collector-rrc&#34;&gt;Remote Route Collectors (RRT)&lt;/a&gt; and to examine whether
a country’s prefixes are withdrawn when an internet blackout is being reported.
In the Gambia, for example, such data allowed us to monitor the withdrawal and
announcement of Gambian prefixes during the country’s 2016 presidential
election. In fact, Gambian prefixes were
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ooni.torproject.org/post/gambia-internet-shutdown/&#34;&gt;withdrawn&lt;/a&gt; between
30th November to 2nd December, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the
internet blackout occurred during that period, as inferred through &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/traffic/explorer/?r=GM&amp;amp;l=WEBSEARCH&amp;amp;csd=1479483000000&amp;amp;ced=1480692600000&#34;&gt;Google traffic data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OONI has been working on a methodology to automatically identify and
investigate cases of internet blackouts. So for this is something very
experimental and will require more work to have it be production ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;https://ooni.torproject.org/notebooks/internet-blackouts-google-traffic.ipynb&#34;&gt;ipython notebook&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://ooni.torproject.org/notebooks/internet-blackouts-google-traffic.html&#34;&gt;view&lt;/a&gt;)
contains some of the results of the experiments we have been doing.
The same methodology can easily be applied to other datasets other than the
Google traffic data. It would have been useful, and much easier, if Google
Transparency Reports provided an easy to use HTTP API for obtaining the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;cross-referencing-data-sources&#34;&gt;Cross-referencing data sources&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet blackout might not always occur across all networks on a country-wide
level. A government, for example, may order ISPs to shut down the internet only
in a specific location where a protest is taking place, while keeping the
internet accessible in the rest of the country. In such a case, it’s probably
unlikely that Google traffic data would show a complete disruption as
illustrated in the graphs of the previous section, but would rather show a
general decrease in traffic data in comparison to previous dates. As such,
cross-referencing data sources as part of an examination of internet blackout
can be a useful next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way of doing so is by looking at both &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/traffic/?hl=en#expand=CG&#34;&gt;Google traffic data&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://metrics.torproject.org/&#34;&gt;Tor Metrics&lt;/a&gt; for a particular country during
the same period of time. It’s unlikely, for example, that there would be a total
internet blackout if there is normal usage of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/&#34;&gt;Tor network&lt;/a&gt; during a reported blackout. If, however,
there is a spike in Tor usage and Google traffic data is significantly decreased
in comparison to previous dates, then it might be the case that censorship
events are occurring in certain networks, leading to the increased usage of
censorship circumvention software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is illustrated through the example below where we can see decreased Google
traffic data and &lt;a href=&#34;https://metrics.torproject.org/userstats-relay-country.html?start=2016-08-06&amp;amp;end=2016-11-04&amp;amp;country=et&amp;amp;events=off&#34;&gt;increased usage of Tor software&lt;/a&gt; in Ethiopia
in October 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ooni.torproject.org/post/ethiopia-report/et-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;Google data&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ooni.torproject.org/post/ethiopia-report/et-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;Tor metrics&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When cross-referencing data sources, it might also be useful to look at the
geotagging of posts on social media platforms, such as Twitter. Unlike the
aforementioned public data sources (e.g. Google transparency reports) which show
an overview of traffic originating from a country, the geotags on posts allow us
to drill down to a specific region or city in a country (if the geotags are
accurate). This is particularly useful if, for example, locals are reporting a
blackout in a country, Google traffic data does not show a clear blackout, but
you’re interested in examining whether the approximate internet activity
originating from a specific city or region has been disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process involves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collecting all of the posts of a social media platform (e.g. via Twitter’s API)
that are geotagged with the region that you are interested in;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calculating the approximate amount of geotagged posts within the time range that
you are interested in;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evaluating whether there is a significant decrease of geotagged posts on the
specific dates of a reported internet blackout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is illustrated through the graph below that we
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ooni.torproject.org/post/ethiopia-internet-shutdown-amidst-recent-protests/&#34;&gt;created&lt;/a&gt; based on tweets geotagged in Ethiopia between 3rd-9th August
2016, indicating a decrease of Twitter activity in the country on 7th August
2016 when an internet blackout was reported in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ooni.torproject.org/post/ethiopia-internet-shutdown-amidst-recent-protests/ethiopia-tweets.png&#34; alt=&#34;Ethiopia Tweets&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, such data should probably only be used supplementary when cross-
referencing data sources, since it is subject to various limitations (for
example, Twitter users in a country might be inactive due to reasons unrelated
to an internet blackout).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless all data sources that you refer to show absolutely no internet traffic
originating from a country or the prefixes within a country are completely
withdrawn, it’s hard to reach an accurate conclusion on whether an internet
blackout has occurred or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the publicly available data sources mentioned in this post can help
gain some insight into the flow of internet traffic in most countries around the
world, and they can help provide &lt;em&gt;signs&lt;/em&gt; of internet blackout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We encourage more companies (such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.akamai.com/&#34;&gt;Akamai&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cloudflare.com/&#34;&gt;CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fastly.com/&#34;&gt;Fastly&lt;/a&gt;)
to publish data on network traffic originating from countries to help increase
transparency when heavy network disruptions occur. We also encourage you all to
support Access Now’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/&#34;&gt;#KeepItOn campaign&lt;/a&gt;
for a stable and open internet around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Gambia: Internet Shutdown during 2016 Presidential Election</title>
      <link>https://ooni.torproject.org/post/gambia-internet-shutdown/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ooni.torproject.org/post/gambia-internet-shutdown/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Last week we attempted to perform &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe&#34;&gt;OONI network measurement tests&lt;/a&gt; in the Gambia
to examine whether websites were blocked during its 2016 presidential election.
But merely a few hours after we connected our probe to perform tests, it stopped
working completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We suspected that this was due to an internet shutdown. To confirm this, we
referred to third-party data to examine whether a country-wide internet blackout
was taking place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this report, we summarize some of our key findings pertaining to the internet
shutdown that appears to have occurred in the Gambia on the eve of its 2016
presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;2016-presidential-election&#34;&gt;2016 presidential election&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Yahya Jammeh &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-38183906&#34;&gt;governed&lt;/a&gt; the Gambia for 22 years, following a coup in
1994. Since then, Jammeh won every election and reportedly &lt;a href=&#34;http://qz.com/850002/gambias-government-has-shut-down-the-internet-on-the-eve-of-elections/&#34;&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; that he
intended to rule for “one billion years”. The opposition, however, became
increasingly popular and Adama Barrow of the United Democratic Party &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-38183906&#34;&gt;won&lt;/a&gt; the
last elections on 1st December 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands of opposition supporters &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.africanews.com/2016/11/30/no-demonstrations-after-elections-gambia-s-jammeh-orders/&#34;&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; peacefully leading up to the
elections. Omar Amadou Jallow, an opposition leader for the People’s Progressive
Party, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sfchronicle.com/news/world/article/Gambia-s-president-warns-against-protests-after-10644654.php&#34;&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“For 22 years we have realized that Gambia has been turned into a prison; the
arrests, the tensions, the torture and many of our people have gone into exile
&amp;hellip; That shows the tyranny of the regime.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Jammeh &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sfchronicle.com/news/world/article/Gambia-s-president-warns-against-protests-after-10644654.php&#34;&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; the protests, arguing that there was no reason for
anybody to demonstrate since the Gambia’s election system is rig-proof, and that
“demonstrations are the loopholes that are used to destabilize African
governments”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet shutdowns, carried out for stifling communications amongst protesters,
have become increasingly &lt;a href=&#34;http://qz.com/850002/gambias-government-has-shut-down-the-internet-on-the-eve-of-elections/&#34;&gt;common&lt;/a&gt; in African countries during election periods. On
the eve of the Gambia’s election, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/&#34;&gt;Keep It On campaign&lt;/a&gt; published an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton-joint-letter-internet-election-gambia/&#34;&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; to President Jammeh, requesting that the internet is kept on to ensure
the stability and openness of the internet during the 2016 elections. However,
there appears to have been a country-wide internet blackout, as documented
through data in the section below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;internet-shutdown&#34;&gt;Internet shutdown&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through BGP announcement data aggregated by RIPE from 18 different &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ripe.net/analyse/internet-measurements/routing-information-service-ris/faq-ris/what-is-a-remote-route-collector-rrc&#34;&gt;Remote Route Collectors (RRC)&lt;/a&gt; we can see that the first update withdrawing a prefix inside of
Gambia dates 2016-11-30 20:04:04.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are the times at which each of the RRCs saw the first Gambian prefix
withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around this time it was confirmed from various sources that internet
connectivity in the Gambia was being disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear though if this was done intentionally, or if it was a
mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see, however, from the above &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/traffic/explorer/?r=GM&amp;amp;l=WEBSEARCH&amp;amp;csd=1479483000000&amp;amp;ced=1480692600000&#34;&gt;Google traffic graph&lt;/a&gt; that some users at that
time were accessing Google, indicating that connectivity was actually restored
for a brief period of time and that people took advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet connectivity though appears to have lasted for a very short amount of
time, as the routes were unannounced at 5:06.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several sources, including our own researchers on the ground, confirmed that the
internet had started working again at 12:00 UTC of 2nd December, after the
Gambia’s 2016 presidential election had concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can also be confirmed through the graphs below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;keepiton&#34;&gt;#KeepItOn&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet shutdowns, especially when carried out during elections and other
political events, pose restrictions to human rights because they limit the
public&amp;rsquo;s ability to communicate, coordinate, share and access information.
Shutdowns can also harm business interests and foreign relations, if carried out
for extended periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We encourage organizations around the world to support &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/&#34;&gt;Access Now&amp;rsquo;s #KeepItOn campaign&lt;/a&gt; for a stable and open internet around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ethiopia: Internet Shutdown Amidst Recent Protests?</title>

&lt;p&gt;Nearly 100 deaths and thousands of arrests have been
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37015055&#34;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in Ethiopia over the
last days, as part of protests against the marginalization and persecution of
the Oromos and Amharas, Ethiopia’s two largest ethnic groups. But the attacks
and arrests may not have been the only forms of retribution carried out by the
Ethiopian government in its crackdown against protesters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, the internet was
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36940906&#34;&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; shut down in the
country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to understand whether the internet was in fact shut down, we
looked at some public sources of data that contain information about internet
traffic. Such data provides strong indicators that the internet was most likely
shut down during the Ethiopian protests last weekend, though it remains unclear
if this occurred in all regions and/or on all types of networks across the
country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ethiopian-protests&#34;&gt;Ethiopian protests&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ongoing
&lt;a href=&#34;http://africanarguments.org/2016/08/06/ethiopias-unprecedented-nationwide-oromo-protests-who-what-why/&#34;&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt;
have been carried out by Ethiopia’s Oromo people since November 2015, marking
one of the most significant political developments in Ethiopia in recent years.
These protests were sparked by the introduction of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-14/ethiopia-oromo-protests-trigger-fatal-ethnic-clashes-group-says&#34;&gt;Addis Ababa City
Integrated Master
Plan&lt;/a&gt;,
which aims to expand the territorial limits of the country’s capital into
neighbouring Oromo towns, threatening to displace millions of Oromo farmers and
bring the Oromo-dominated region under Tigray-led federal government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unprecedented wave of protests has resulted in more than 400 deaths over
the last months, according to a recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/06/16/such-brutal-crackdown/killings-and-arrests-response-ethiopias-oromo-protests&#34;&gt;Human Rights Watch
report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More &lt;a href=&#34;http://africanarguments.org/2016/08/06/ethiopias-unprecedented-nationwide-oromo-protests-who-what-why/&#34;&gt;protests sprung up in the Amhara regional
state&lt;/a&gt;,
with protesters requesting for political reforms and specifically, the Welkait
community demanding that ancestral land currently administered by the Tigray
regional state be moved into the neighbouring Amhara region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new-found unity between the two historically antagonistic communities of
the Oromo and Amharas against a common adversary, the TPLF-led government,
seems to have raised the tension in the country. The security forces response
has been extreme, with observers
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article57643&#34;&gt;comparing&lt;/a&gt; it to the 2005
post-election violence where nearly 200 people were killed. This time though,
at least &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/08/ethiopia-dozens-killed-as-police-use-excessive-force-against-peaceful-protesters/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=quote&amp;amp;utm_term=The+security+forces%25u2019+response+was+heavy-handed%2c+but+unsurprising.+Ethiopian+forces+have+systematically+used+excessive+force+in+their+mistaken+attempts+to+silence+dissenting+voices&amp;amp;utm_campaign=social&#34;&gt;30 people were reportedly
killed&lt;/a&gt;
in the Amhara region in one day alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;internet-shutdown&#34;&gt;Internet shutdown&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protesters relied on the internet to plan, mobilize and coordinate with each
other and this may have &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36940906&#34;&gt;prompted the Ethiopian
government&lt;/a&gt; to pull the plug on
the internet even before the planned protests started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is not the first time that the Ethiopian government appears to be
restricting access to the internet this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, the government
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36763572&#34;&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; blocked social
media sites across the country after &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10102310909934763&amp;amp;set=pb.215693.-2207520000.1470776183.&amp;amp;type=3&amp;amp;theater&#34;&gt;University entrance exams were leaked on
Facebook&lt;/a&gt;
by an Oromo activist, as a form of protest against the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public data from last weekend indicates that the internet was shut down in
Ethiopia during the heat of the protests, but it remains unclear if this
occurred nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graphs below illustrate that while internet traffic appeared to be
originating from Ethiopia up until August 5th, such traffic was suddenly
terminated until August 8th, indicating that the internet was probably shut
down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ooni.torproject.org/post/ethiopia-internet-shutdown-amidst-recent-protests/ethiopia-google-traffic.png&#34; alt=&#34;Ethiopia google traffic&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google products traffic for users from Ethiopia from July 22nd to August 8th&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ooni.torproject.org/post/ethiopia-internet-shutdown-amidst-recent-protests/ethiopia-ndt-measurements.png&#34; alt=&#34;Ethiopia NDT Measurements&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NDT measurements started by users from July 20th to August 8th&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following graph, which we created based on tweets geotagged in Ethiopia
from 3rd-9th August, also illustrates a decrease of Twitter activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ooni.torproject.org/post/ethiopia-internet-shutdown-amidst-recent-protests/ethiopia-tweets.png&#34; alt=&#34;Ethiopia Tweets&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, &lt;a href=&#34;https://metrics.torproject.org/&#34;&gt;Tor metrics data&lt;/a&gt; below
illustrates that there was a decrease in the usage of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/&#34;&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt; last weekend, which could be viewed as an
indicator of the internet being restricted or shut down in certain types of
networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ooni.torproject.org/post/ethiopia-internet-shutdown-amidst-recent-protests/ethiopia-tor-metrics.png&#34; alt=&#34;Ethiopia tor metrics&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ooni.torproject.org/post/ethiopia-internet-shutdown-amidst-recent-protests/ethiopia-tor-metrics-2.png&#34; alt=&#34;Ethiopia tor metrics&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tor metrics data for direct connecting users&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data included in the graphs above shows that while the internet was likely
shut down in certain regions and/or types of networks, it probably wasn’t shut
down completely across Ethiopia. It might also have been the case that access
to certain websites was restricted in regions and/or networks where the
internet was accessible, though we unfortunately don’t have any recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://explorer.ooni.torproject.org/country/ET&#34;&gt;OONI
measurements&lt;/a&gt; from Ethiopia to
verify this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;keepiton-campaign&#34;&gt;#KeepItOn campaign&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet shutdowns effectively pose restrictions on demonstrations and on human
rights generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the recent case of Ethiopia, shutting down the internet in the middle of
intense protests likely not only had an effect on the mobilization and
coordination of protesters, but also on the communication between families and
friends of victims. This also likely had an effect on journalists reporting on
the protests in real-time on the ground, if they were using networks that were
blocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Al Jazeera reporter in Addis Ababa cited difficulties to connect to the
internet and restricted travel to protest zones as a cause for limited coverage
of the protests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;It works abit differently with TV. We must verify reports we get. We however covered Addis protests on sat. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/qHGw9Vdy1u&#34;&gt;https://t.co/qHGw9Vdy1u&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Catherine Soi (@C_SOI) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/C_SOI/status/762388008666591232&#34;&gt;August 7, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Internet back after 48 hours of total blackout across the whole &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ethiopia?src=hash&#34;&gt;#Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;. However, it&amp;#39;s still blocked in Amhara &amp;amp; oromia region.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ethiopian Press (@abenezer_a) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/abenezer_a/status/762569928205533184&#34;&gt;August 8, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Ethiopia is not the only country restricting access to the internet during
political events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/#resources&#34;&gt;20 cases of internet
shutdowns&lt;/a&gt; have been documented
worldwide over the last six months alone. In response to this, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.accessnow.org/&#34;&gt;Access
Now&lt;/a&gt; is leading a campaign in collaboration with
organizations around the world called #KeepItOn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/&#34;&gt;#KeepItOn&lt;/a&gt; campaign aims to document
and raise awareness about internet shutdowns around the world. We support this
campaign, and we hope you will too.&lt;/p&gt;
