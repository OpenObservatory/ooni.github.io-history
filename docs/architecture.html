<p>The purpose of this goal is to illustrate the design goals of the various
components part of the OONI ecosystem, how they work and what is the
relationship between each other.</p>
<p>The following diagram gives you an idea of how the various OONI components
are related to each other.</p>

<p>ooni-probe the client side component of OONI that is responsible for performing
measurements on the to be tested network.</p>
<p>Originally thought of as a tool to be used by users to investigate network
anomalies on their own and quickly implement new tests to check for new
censorship conditions, the focus is now shifting more towards something
meant to be used in an unattended manner.</p>
<p>As such it&#8217;s evolving into being a system daemon that is always running on
a users machine and automatically performs the network measurements the user
has instructed it to perform.</p>
<div class="section" id="design-goals">
<h2>Design goals<a class="headerlink" href="#design-goals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The current design goals are:</p>
<p><strong>Unattended measurement collection</strong></p>
<p>It should be possible for a user of the system to install it and forget about
it. This means that it shouldn&#8217;t be necessary to constantly interact with the tool
itself.</p>
<p>Previously some of the design considerations for ooni-probe used to be:</p>
<p><strong>Test specification decoupling</strong></p>
<p>This design goal is still largely valid, though as ooni-probe grows as mainly
an enduser tool it&#8217;s importance will be decreasing.</p>
<p>Moreover the long-term plan for this is given the fact that tests are going to
be run based on <a class="reference internal" href="#measurement-kit">measurement-kit</a> is to have the testing framework logic be
implemented in the <a class="reference internal" href="#measurement-kit">measurement-kit</a> scripting language.</p>
<p>The outline of this design goal nonetheless is that the definition of the test
should be as loosely coupled to the code that is used for running the test.</p>
<p>This is achieved via what are called <strong>Test Templates</strong>. Test Templates a high
level interface to the test developer specific to the protocol they are writing
a test for.
The Test template will then be responsible for implementing the measurement
logic, generic error handling and the formatting of reports using a format that
is standard for the type of test that is being run.</p>
<p>This does not mean that test developers should only include in their report
tests what is generated for them by the test template, but, when using Test
Templates, the report will always be a superset of what is provided by the test
template.</p>
<p>For example the a test based on the <a class="reference internal" href="api/ooni.templates.html#ooni.templates.httpt.HTTPTest" title="ooni.templates.httpt.HTTPTest"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">ooni.templates.httpt.HTTPTest</span></code></a> test
template will always have the list of HTTP requests performed and the responses
received, but a developer may with to include inside of their report the
checksum of the of the content as is show in the example in <a class="reference external" href="writing_tests.html">Writing Tests</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Support for high concurrency</strong></p>
<p>By this I mean that we want to be able to scan through big lists as fast as
possible.</p>
<p>The problem when doing censorship measurement tests is that you often have to
deal with very big lists and going over these lists sequentially is slow and
time consuming.</p>
<p>For this purpose we have chosen to use the <a class="reference external" href="http://twistedmatrix.org">Twisted networking framework</a>. The reasons for using Twisted are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>It is stable and has been around for many year (version 1.0 came out 11 years XXX citation)</li>
<li>People in the Tor community use it</li>
<li>People in the Python community use it</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>If you have an argument for which you believe Twisted is not a good idea, I
would love to know :).</p>
<p>Running lot&#8217;s of tests concurrently can reduce their accuracy. The ideal
strategy for dealing with this would involve adjusting the concurrency
based on failure rate.
Currently this is not implemented inside of ooniprobe and instead we use
a configurable concurrency value that is set to default as 3.</p>

<div class="section" id="implementation-details">
<h2>Implementation details<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation-details" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Below is a high level diagram of how the various modules of ooniprobe
are interrelated to each other.</p>
<img src="_images/graphviz-79d09bb89fc534a08eadce8eddb6040f7df6b254.png" alt="digraph ooniprobe_impl {

    &quot;deck&quot; -&gt; &quot;backend_client&quot;;
    &quot;deck&quot; -&gt; &quot;nettests&quot;;
}" />
<p>ooni-probe is written in python using the <a class="reference external" href="http://twistedmatrix.org">Twisted networking framework</a>.</p>
<p>The two main concepts in ooniprobe are a decks and nettests. A nettest is a
particular network test that is designed to identify one class of anomalies.</p>
<p>A deck is a collection of one or more nettests and some associated inputs (such
as a list of URLs).</p>
<p>The director is responsible for starting the measurement and reporting task
managers, starting tor, looking up the IP address of the probe and in general
controlling the lifecycle of the application.</p>
<p>The schedulers are periodic tasks that need to be executed (think cron). Their
state is kept track of on disk (in particular the last time a successful
execution was performed).</p>
<p>The agent is responsible for starting director, the schedulers and exposing the
web user interface.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Measurement-kit is a C++ library that implements network measurement primitives
and some of the ooniprobe tests.</p>
<p>It has been developed with the goal of being able to target mobile platforms
(Android and iOS), but is growing with the intent of eventually replacing the
measurement engine of ooniprobe entirely with native code.</p>
<p>There is work in progress to support calling it from python (see:
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/measurement-kit/measurement-kit/pull/697">https://github.com/measurement-kit/measurement-kit/pull/697</a>) and there
are plans to implement a scripting interface around it to aid the development of
tests (see: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/measurement-kit/measurement-kit/issues/702">https://github.com/measurement-kit/measurement-kit/issues/702</a>).</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This is the backend component of OONI. It is responsible for exposing <a class="reference internal" href="#test-helpers">test
helpers</a> , the <a class="reference internal" href="#measurement-collector">measurement collector</a> and the <a class="reference internal" href="#bouncer-service">bouncer service</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="test-helpers">
<h2>Test Helpers<a class="headerlink" href="#test-helpers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Test helpers implement server side protocols that are of assistance to
ooniprobes when running tests.</p>
<p>If you would like to see a test helper implemented inside of oonib, thats
great!
All you have to do is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-backend/issues/new?title=[new%20test-helper%20request]%20YOUR_TESTHELPER_NAME">open a ticket on github</a>.</p>
<p>To get an idea of the current implementation status of test helpers see the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-backend/tree/master/oonib/testhelpers">oonib/testhelpers/</a>
directory of the ooniprobe git repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="measurement-collector">
<h2>Measurement collector<a class="headerlink" href="#measurement-collector" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is the service that is used for submitting measurement results to.</p>
<p>The specification for the API of the measurement collector can be found here:

</div>
<div class="section" id="bouncer-service">
<h2>Bouncer service<a class="headerlink" href="#bouncer-service" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is the service that is responsible for informing clients of where they
should be submitting their results to and what are the addresses of the
test-helpers they require to perform their measurements.</p>
<p>The specification for the API of the bouncer can be found here:
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-spec/blob/master/oonib.md#40-bouncer">https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-spec/blob/master/oonib.md#40-bouncer</a></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>When measurements are submitted to a measurement collector they are then
processed by the data pipeline.</p>
<p>The measurements are first normalised (to take into account the different data
formats that ooniprobe has supported over time), then sanitised (to redact from them
sensitive information such a private bridge IP address) and then put inside of a
database to be served via the <a class="reference internal" href="#ooni-explorer">ooni-explorer</a>.</p>
<p>It is currently written in python using the <a class="reference external" href="https://luigi.readthedocs.org">luigi workflow manager</a>, but that may change in the near future.
For future plans see: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-pipeline/issues/32">https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-pipeline/issues/32</a></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This is the web interface that is used by end users to inspect measurements
collected by ooniprobe.</p>
<p>It is written as a node.js web app (based on the strongloop framework), with
angular.js and d3.js.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Web user interface assets and the implementation of the ooni-probe web
interface. Components in here are meant to be re-used across the various
software components (ooni-probe, ooni-explorer, net-probe, etc.), though work
on this from is not yet complete.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A raspberry pi image for running ooniprobe.</p>
<p>Amongst other things it takes care of automatically updating ooniprobe to the
latest version and packaging all the dependencies required to run ooniprobe.</p>
